## Challenge
ðŸŽµ Genre Jukebox

**Objective:** A jukebox that reveals top artists from different genres at the press of a button.

**Tasks:**

1. Craft `GenreJukebox.js` within the `components` folder.
2. Design five buttons corresponding to these genres: Rap, R&B, Pop, Country, and Afrobeats.
3. When a button is pressed, it should unveil a top artist from that genre.
   
**Hint:** Use React's state to dynamically display the artist based on the button clicked.

**End Result:** When the "Rap" button is pressed, it might reveal "Kendrick Lamar". When the "R&B" button is pressed, it could show "Usher". Pressing "Pop" might display "Ariana Grande", and "Country" will bring up "Luke Bryan". And when the "Afrobeats" button is clicked, it will reveal "Tems".
