**1. 📜 My Chart-Toppers**

Objective: Illuminate your playlist with iconic tracks.

Tasks:
- In the `components` alcove, mold the `Playlist.js`.
- Chronicle legendary tracks from Rod Wave, Brent, Drake, and SZA.
- Employ `.map()` to spotlight each masterpiece in a list symphony.

**Hint:** Ensure each musical note, aka item, carries its own signature `key` prop.

**End Result:** A chart resembling:

```
- Rod Wave: Street Runner
- Brent: Dead Man Walking
- Drake: Laugh Now Cry Later
- SZA: Good Days
```

**2. 🔔 Melody Request**

Objective: Design an apparatus to echo song desires.

Tasks:
- Engineer the `SongRequestBell.js`.
- Upon pressing the bell, let it resonate an alert echoing a song's yearning.

**Hint:** The `onClick` event is your maestro here.

**End Result:** A beckoning button tagged "Request a Song", which when enticed, proclaims: "Song request acknowledged!"

**3. 🎧 Echoing Tunes**

Objective: Chronicle the encore of your favorite songs.

Tasks:
- Blueprint the `TrackPlays.js`.
- Conjure a button emblematic of a track, where every engagement amplifies the encore count.

**Hint:** The `useState` spell is paramount here.

**End Result:** A button serenading "Play Rod Wave: Tombstone". With each embrace, the button reverberates: "Encored X times!"

## 🎤 Challenge: Tunes & Genres

**🎵 Genre Jukebox**

Objective: A jukebox to unveil music maestros across genres.

Tasks:

1. In the `components` chamber, craft `GenreJukebox.js`.
2. Curate buttons, each a tribute to genres: Rap, R&B, Pop, Country, and Afrobeats.
3. On a button's embrace, let it reveal a genre's luminary.

**Hint:** Employ React's essence, the state, to dynamically spotlight an artist as per the genre's call.

**End Result:** "Rap" might resonate "Kendrick Lamar", "R&B" could echo "Usher", "Pop" might harmonize "Ariana Grande", "Country" might croon "Luke Bryan", and "Afrobeats" will likely celebrate "Tems".

**📻 Maestro's Frequency**

Objective: An avenue for aficionados to sync with their cherished artist's wavelength.

Tasks:

1. In the `components` fold, draft `RadioSelector.js`.
2. Within `RadioSelector`, curate radio dial options for maestros: Rod Wave, Brent, Drake, and SZA.
3. Below the dials, place a "Tune In" button.
4. Engaging the "Tune In" should broadcast the dialed artist's symphony.

**Hint:** Dive into the intricacies of radio dials in HTML to capture a listener's choice.

**End Result:** A choice of radio frequencies, each a tribute to an artist. Say, upon tuning into "Drake" and pressing "Tune In", the ether should resonate: "Now serenading: Drake Radio".
